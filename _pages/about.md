Hi, I'm Kehan Guo, a Ph.D student in Computer Science and Engineering at the  [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), advised by [Professor.Xiangliang Zhang](https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/). I am also glad to be a member of [NSF Center for Computer Assisted Synthesis (C-CAS)](https://ccas.nd.edu/).Before that, I earned my M.S in [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/).

> I am seeking potential research collaborations and the position of industry research intern. If you are interested, please [contact me](mailto:kguo2@nd.edu).

I am exploring how to enhance the **reasoning & planning** capabilities of Large Language Models to address problem in scientific domain. 

For technologies, my studies encompass **Large language models (LLM)**, **LLM-based agents**, **Machine Unlearning**, and **Generative Models**.

For practical applications, my studies encompass Scientific Domains, OOD detection, and Automated ML Systems, which naturally require better planning and reasoning capabilities of intelligent systems.
