Hi, I'm Kehan Guo, a Ph.D student in Computer Science and Engineering at the  [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), advised by [Professor.Xiangliang Zhang](https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/). I am also glad to be a member of [NSF Center for Computer Assisted Synthesis (C-CAS)](https://ccas.nd.edu/).Before that, I earned my M.S in [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/).

> I am seeking potential research collaborations and the position of industry research intern. If you are interested, please [contact me](mailto:kguo2@nd.edu).


&#128214; Research
------
<p>My research is centered on three pivotal topics:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Enhancing Reasoning of Generative Models:</strong> Developing robust frameworks to evaluate and improve the reasoning and planning ability of foundational generative models within specific application domains.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Superior Approaches to Achieving AGI:</strong> Exploring data-centric methods for scalable model alignment and evolution to achieve Artificial General Intelligence that adheres to human values and ethical standards.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Effectiveness in Downstream Applications:</strong> Critically assessing the practical impact of current AI technologies on downstream applications, particularly their transformative potential in fields like AI4Science, agentic models, and social sciences.
    </li>
</ul>
